# EZPassIL

## Description
EZPassIL is a lightweight, developer-friendly React application that simulates a simplified toll management dashboard tailored for Illinois E-ZPass users and developers. It provides a clean interface for recording, viewing, and managing toll-related expenses and receipts, ideal for prototyping features such as expense logging, receipt generation, and basic reporting workflows. Built with modular, component-driven code, the project emphasizes readability and easy extensibility so contributors can quickly add features like authentication, API integration, or advanced analytics. The UI is intentionally minimal, using plain CSS for predictable styling and straightforward component composition to support accessibility and rapid iteration. Sample components include an expense form, an expense list, receipt preview, and a header/navigation component — all wired into a simple application state flow that newcomers can follow. The repository includes testing scaffolding, a clear contribution guide, and a polished README to help developers get started. Whether you are building a production-grade E-ZPass management tool, learning React fundamentals, or preparing a prototype for stakeholder review, EZPassIL serves as a pragmatic starting point that balances practicality with instructional clarity. It encourages collaboration through clear documentation, issue templates, and maintainable code patterns for long-term project health. Developers of all levels are welcome to contribute and learn here.
