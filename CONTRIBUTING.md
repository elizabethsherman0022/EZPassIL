# Contributing to EZPassIL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EZPassIL! This document outlines how to contribute, report issues, suggest features, and what to expect during the review process.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow the repository coding style (ESLint recommended).
- Keep changes focused and small — one feature or fix per PR.
- Write clear commit messages and include context for reviewers.
- Add or update tests for new behavior where applicable.
- Document notable changes in the PR description.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Make your changes, following the project's structure and style.
4. Update or add tests and documentation.
5. Commit, push to your fork, and open a Pull Request to `main`.
6. Link issues or feature requests your PR addresses.

## Reporting Issues
- Use the repository "Issues" tab.
- Provide steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment (OS, Node version), and screenshots or logs if available.
- Tag the issue clearly (bug, enhancement, docs, question).

## Suggesting Features
- Create a new issue titled `Feature: <concise summary>`.
- Describe the problem, proposed solution, and potential API/UX changes.
- If possible, sketch a small example or wireframe to clarify intent.

## Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and professional at all times.
- Treat contributors with empathy and kindness.
- No harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory behavior.
- Maintain constructive, solution-focused discussions.
- Violations may result in report and removal from contribution privileges.

## Review Process
- PRs will be reviewed by at least one maintainer.
- Reviews focus on correctness, readability, test coverage, and documentation.
- You may be asked to make iterative improvements; please respond promptly.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR — squash or rebase may be used.
